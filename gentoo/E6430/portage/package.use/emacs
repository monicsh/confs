# * Your version of GTK+ will have problems with closing open
# * displays. This is no problem if you just use one display, but
# * if you use more than one and close one of them Emacs may crash.
# * See <https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=85715>.
# * If you intend to use more than one display, then it is strongly
# * recommended that you compile Emacs with the Athena/Lucid or the
# * Motif toolkit instead.
# * You can set the version to be started by /usr/bin/emacs through the
# * Emacs eselect module, which also redirects man and info pages.
# * Therefore, several Emacs versions can be installed at the same time.
# * "man emacs.eselect" for details.
# * 
# * If you upgrade from Emacs version 24.2 or earlier, then it is
# * strongly recommended that you use app-admin/emacs-updater to rebuild
# * all byte-compiled elisp files of the installed Emacs packages.
# * 
# * (Note: Above message is only printed the first time package is
# * installed. Please look at /usr/share/doc/emacs-25.2_rc1/README.gentoo*
# * for future reference)
